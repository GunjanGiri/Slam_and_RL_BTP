\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this report, we successfully learnt about SLAM and Swarm Intelligence. We begin with understand various slam method. Then, we implement various RL algorithm(Q-learning, Sarsa, DQN) to solve the mountain car problem to understand these algorithm in depth. Later, we also used some of these algorithms to control the quad-copter. We show that how these method ease the process control compered to conventional method of pid tuning.\\
In the later part, studied various swarm algorithm and shown that how multiple robot together can perform most of the task better than any of individual robot in group can.\\

It seems we have build sufficient theoretically background and also have tested and varified our algorithm on simulated robots. Its high time we start implementing algorithm on hardware and further improve them. Hence in future, I will be working to implement this algorithms on hardware.\\
