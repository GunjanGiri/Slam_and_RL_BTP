\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this report, I presented the my worked starting form writing pid controller for a drone, then I implement the Q learning on simple game of mountain car and at end I simulated the ARdrone using ROS and openAI gym.
\\
This was a just a start, there is a lot of ground to cover. In future I will working on improving the Q learning algorithm specific to the task and also will be learning to build the custom environment to test the algorithms.
\\
I will working on the different variant of the above problem for example, training the drone to chase another drone, to navigated in restricted environments etc.
